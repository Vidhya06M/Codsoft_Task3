# Codsoft_Task3


This project combines computer vision and natural language processing to build an image captioning AI. The system uses pre-trained image recognition models like VGG or ResNet to extract features from images and a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to generate captions for those images.


This project aims to create a powerful and efficient image captioning AI system. By leveraging pre-trained models for feature extraction and advanced NLP models for caption generation, the system can produce accurate and meaningful descriptions of images.

Model Architecture
The image captioning AI is built using a combination of a pre-trained CNN for feature extraction and an RNN or transformer-based model for caption generation.

Feature Extraction
VGG or ResNet: These models are used to extract high-level features from the input images. The final fully connected layer's output is used as the feature vector.
Caption Generation
RNN/LSTM: A recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) units to handle the sequential nature of text data.
Transformer: An alternative approach using a transformer-based model to capture complex dependencies in the caption generation process.
